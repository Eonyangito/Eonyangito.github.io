    "<strong>How fit should a model be?</strong><br>\n",
    "As a general heuristic, if the training and testing scores are within 0.05 of each other, the model has not been overfit. Don't worry if the testing score ends up higher than the training score. Some sources claim that in such situations a model is underfit, but this is a general misconception that is beyond the scope of this course. For this course, long as the training and testing scores are within 0.05 of each other, the model is good to go.\n",

    "#  Analysis Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Bike rental services has become a day to day activity and its clear that the masses are joining this phenomena that we are witnessing. Various sources of data are indicating the increase of bike rental demand in the country and this stems from either increase in personal health awareness, infrastructure to cater for , affordability of this service and the level of conveniency it comes with.\n",
    "The data available below helps us understand the reason why the industry is key and the need for having a keen eye placed on it. The level of demand  for this service keeps on increasing thus making it very lucrative for a number of reasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task at hand is to come up with a ML model \n",
    "The below code helps us dive deep into it as we try understand the best way possible of showing how important and the potential the industry has for growth with the use of KNNeighbors model of regression and other data exploration tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Base modeling allows us to analyze the different specific data columns and how the relate to each other.In this case using a profound correlation matrix will help us get results that could be fruitful in our analysis of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal data needs cleaning before exploration and analysis is done on it to determine the necessary output to be derived from it in this case our data had Visibility(miles) with 76 null values, DewPointTemperature(F) with 67 null values,SolarRadiation(MJ/m2) with 106 null values and RENTALS with 546 null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we imputed the missing values for Visibility,DewPointTemperature and SolarRadiation using the median value to \n",
    "enable the uniformity of the data in question since the missing values were less compared to the total data from the specific columns. For rentals the missing values would be used in determining the new values to be imputed into those slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Engineering ##\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature One ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The ambient air temperature (Temperature(F)) measures how hot or cold the surrounding air is in degrees Fahrenheit. \n",
    "It indicates the thermal energy present.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dew point temperature (DewPointTemperature(F)) is the temperature at which the air becomes saturated with moisture, \n",
    "at 100% relative humidity. At this point, water vapor in the air condenses into liquid water or dew.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between these two temperatures (Temperature_DewPoint_diff) provides information about the moisture content in the air. A smaller difference means the air contains more water vapor and feels more humid. A larger difference indicates drier air.\n",
    "\n",
    "This engineered feature can improve predictive models for various applications impacted by humidity levels. In energy use models, humidity impacts cooling equipment requirements and efficiency. Days with high humidity and high tmeperature isnt fit for bike rentals since the mechanics are prone to be affected while on the other hand people would avoid bike riding in such conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Two ##\n",
    "# Humidity and Temperature Interaction \n",
    "\n",
    "Humidity (Humidity(%)) measures the amount of water vapor present in air as a percentage of the maximum amount that can be held at a given temperature. It indicates how saturated the air is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature (Temperature(F)) reflects the ambient thermal energy, measured in degrees Fahrenheit. Higher values mean hotter air.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction between humidity and temperature (Humidity_Temp_interaction) captures their combined effect on outcomes sensitive to climatic conditions. Individually, humidity and temperature may not fully represent their unique impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, perceived heat discomfort is a function of both humidity and temperature.Heat index shows how high the situations get to which on the other hand affect the rate at which bike rentals take place\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, high heat and humidity exacerbate pollution and health issues. This feature helps us see how best temperature and humidity\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Three ##\n",
    "\n",
    "# Weather Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "Visibility (Visibility(miles)) measures how far one can clearly see, indicating the presence of obstructions like fog, rain, or snow. Higher values mean more unhindered sight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rainfall (Rainfall(in)) and snowfall (Snowfall(in)) quantify precipitation over a time period in inches. More rain or snow means reduced visibility and wet conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The engineered feature Weather_Condition integrates these components by subtracting total precipitation (rain + snow) from visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, higher Weather_Condition values represent clearer weather with high visibility and minimal rain/snow. Lower values indicate poor visibility with significant precipitation occurring. As stated the forseen element of having poor visibility is key when it comes to rental of bikes \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Candidate Model development\n",
    "Throughout the whole progress having explored , cleaned and analyzed my data I decided to use the KNearestNeighbors model. This model is used to evaluate a diverse set of ML algorithms to predict the problem at hand. In this case I went straight to the hyperprarameters where the model looked into each algorithm using randomized search to validate the training set and tune it for predictions. The model splits the data into a 80-20 split to trian and the rest to test it. As i continued I tracked performance to see overrall accuracy using the AUC and ROC precision rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the strong predictive accuracy, interpretability, and ease of implementation, I selected the KNearestNeighbors model  neighbors, uniform weights, and Euclidean distance metric as the best performing option for the deployment system. This combination of algorithms and hyperparameters maximized generalization performance on new unseen data, in my case the prediction capability of KNN was optimal to the data frame\n",
